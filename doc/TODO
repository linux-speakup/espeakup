This file contains a list of improvements that need to be made to
espeakup.

Voice and language support should be added at some point.
This will consist of the following:
- add a function which will allow switching voices.  (completed on 9/27)
- add a function/command which will allow speakup to find out which
  voices espeak supports.
- define and add the command to speakup which will allow it to switch
  voices.
