.SH DESCRIPTION
Espeakup bridges the gap between two tools: the Speakup screen review
system and the ESppeak text-to-speech engine.  Each of these tools
performs a well-defined task.  Speakup is a kernel-based screen reader
for the Linux console.  It extracts and processes the text that is
displayed on the foreground virtual console.  It supports several
hardware based speech synthesizers directly.  However, since it is in
kernel space, it cannot support a software speech synthesizer directly
since these are in user space.
ESpeak is a popular software speech synthesizer.  It is small, light
weight, very responsive, and supports multiple languages.
Espeakup is a connector which will read text sent to it by speakup and
forward it to ESpeak.  This allows Speakup to use ESpeak as its speech
synthesizer.
.PP
Espeakup is a daemon.  Typically, it is started at boot time, and it terminates
when the system is halted or rebooted.  It should be started by the
system's init scripts.  This process varies among Linux distributions,
but the details are usually managed by the person who packaged Espeakup for
your distribution.
From the perspective of an average user, Espeakup's operation is invisible.
.SH BUGS
.PP
Espeakup is still classified as alpha software.  Bugs are periodically found
and fixed.  If you find a bug, please do report it to the author.  You
might also consider mentioning it on the mailing list for the Speakup
screenreader.  Visit http://speech.braille.uwo.ca/mailman/listinfo/speakup
